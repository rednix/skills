## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Major Refactor**: Renamed to **Chronos** - Universal Periodic Task Manager
- Generic naming: `financial_*` → `periodic_*` (tables, variables, scripts)
- Standalone unified entry: `todo.py` (replaces `unified_todo.py`)
- New manager: `periodic_task_manager.py` (replaces `financial_activity_manager.py`)
- Database schema: `periodic_tasks` + `periodic_occurrences`
- Support for all periodic use cases (not just financial)
- Robust cron scheduling with past-time protection
- Quota auto-complete fix (only completes up to today)

### Changed
- Unified todo no longer calls `todo.sh` - direct database access
- Improved `complete_activity_cycle` logic to avoid auto-completing future dates

### Fixed
- Cron scheduling failures for past times (now skipped)
- monthly_n_times auto-complete bug (limited to current month up to today)
