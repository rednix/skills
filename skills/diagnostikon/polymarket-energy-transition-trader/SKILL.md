# Energy Transition Trader

> **This is a template.**
> The default signal is keyword-based market discovery combined with probability-extreme detection — remix it with the data sources listed in the Edge Thesis below.
> The skill handles all the plumbing (market discovery, trade execution, safeguards). Your agent provides the alpha.

## Strategy Overview

IEA monthly data vs market-implied adoption rates. Remix: EIA weekly petroleum report, IEA Oil Market Report, BloombergNEF energy transition data, IRENA capacity statistics.


## Edge Thesis

Energy markets combine slow-moving structural trends with sharp policy-driven catalysts:

- **EV adoption curve**: IEA publishes monthly EV sales data. When markets price EV milestone probabilities, they frequently lag IEA's published trajectory by 1–2 months
- **OPEC surprise cuts**: OPEC+ meeting outcomes are systematically underpriced in oil threshold markets — the organisation has surprised markets with cuts 70%+ of the time since 2022
- **Nuclear restart markets**: European nuclear restart timelines are public knowledge from regulatory filings but US retail is poorly informed on European energy policy
- **Solar capacity**: IEA and IRENA publish quarterly capacity additions. Markets on "will X GW be installed by Y" frequently underprice given published pipeline data

### Remix Signal Ideas
- **IEA Data**: https://www.iea.org/data-and-statistics
- **EIA Weekly Petroleum Report**: https://www.eia.gov/petroleum/
- **IRENA Statistics**: https://www.irena.org/Statistics
- **OilPrice.com API**: Brent/WTI real-time prices


## Safety & Execution Mode

**The skill defaults to paper trading (`venue="sim"`). Real trades only with `--live` flag.**

| Scenario | Mode | Financial risk |
|---|---|---|
| `python trader.py` | Paper (sim) | None |
| Cron / automaton | Paper (sim) | None |
| `python trader.py --live` | Live (polymarket) | Real USDC |

`autostart: false` and `cron: null` — nothing runs automatically until you configure it in Simmer UI.

## Required Credentials

| Variable | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SIMMER_API_KEY` | Yes | Trading authority. Treat as high-value credential. |

## Tunables (Risk Parameters)

All declared as `tunables` in `clawhub.json` and adjustable from the Simmer UI.

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SIMMER_MAX_POSITION` | See clawhub.json | Max USDC per trade |
| `SIMMER_MIN_VOLUME` | See clawhub.json | Min market volume filter |
| `SIMMER_MAX_SPREAD` | See clawhub.json | Max bid-ask spread |
| `SIMMER_MIN_DAYS` | See clawhub.json | Min days until resolution |
| `SIMMER_MAX_POSITIONS` | See clawhub.json | Max concurrent open positions |
